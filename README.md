# Web<sub>∞</sub>
Reject Web2 and Web3. Embrace Web<sub>∞</sub>

## So what is Web<sub>∞</sub>?

Imagine an internet where typing in any URL you could ever think of doesn't
lead to a 404. An internet where you'll never run out of content to consume.
An internet where you can always find what you're looking for. That's what
Web<sub>∞</sub> is all about.

## How does it work?

Enter a URL into the address bar on the top of the page and wait. AI will
create the content you're looking for. It's that simple.

No seriously, I made a custom prompt for LLAMA 3 that takes a URL and generates
a website for it.

## Is this a bad idea?

Yes. It is 100% a bad idea.

## Why did you make this?

Academia is always saying "you can't use AI or LLMs to write your assignments",
but that's limited to just the code you submit. They can't stop you from using
it _as_ the code you submit...not that I'm using this for anything. Obviously
it's a horrible idea to use this for anything. Don't use it.
